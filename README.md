## About
Author: Stefan Binder


This policy evaluation is part of my master thesis at the University of Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Biroli](https://sites.google.com/site/pietrobiroli/home).


The goal is to replicate the main findings in [McMillen et al. (2017)](https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/assets/Safe_Passage_WP.pdf) of crime reduction due to the Safe Passage program on a census block level.
