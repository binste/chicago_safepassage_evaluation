# Chicago's Safe Passage Program to Prevent Crime: Is It Worth the Dime?
WORK IN PROGRESS


This repository contains an analysis of the effect of Chicago's Safe Passage program on violent crime counts along the guarded routes. The beforementioned program aims at keeping the students safe on their way to school. The policy evaluation is one of two parts of my master thesis at the University of Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Biroli](https://sites.google.com/site/pietrobiroli/home). The second one is a [basic guide to doing reproducible research](https://binste.github.io/basic_reproducibility_guide/), where this analysis serves as an example.

The empirical approach chosen for this analysis follows one of the specifications in a paper called ["Do More Eyes on the Street Reduce Crime? Evidence from Chicagoâ€™s Safe Passage Program"](https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/assets/Safe_Passage_WP.pdf) by Daniel McMillen, Ignacio Sarmiento-Barbieri, and Ruchi Singh from June 22, 2017. It can therefore be seen as an attempt to replicate some of their main findings.

Head over to the [website](https://binste.github.io/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/) of this project, to get an introduction into the topic and a summary of the results.

For a more detailed description of the data used, the empirical strategy as well as its limitations, see the Appendix (XXX)

## Replicate this analysis
Using the two badges below, you can replicate the last stages of the analysis directly in your browser without any setup required.

### Repo2docker
Due to resource constraints on the above used service, to run the whole analysis starting out from the raw data files, you can use the amazing tool repo2docker. It will copy the repository on your own computer and setup everything for you in an isolated environment (using docker).

1. Install the [Docker Community Edition](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
2. Install repo2docker: `pip install jupyter-repo2docker`
3. Build and launch docker image of GitHub repository: `jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation`
4. After it run through, there is an URL which will lead you to XXX

If it does not work, go into Docker preferences and increase resources. XXX what do I have?
