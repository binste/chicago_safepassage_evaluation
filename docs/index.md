**ATTENTION**: This is a work in progress and subject to major changes.

This website is one of two parts of my master thesis (2018) at the University of Zurich and presents an evaluation of the effect of Chicago's Safe Passage program on crime. Furthermore, it serves as an example for the second part of my master thesis, which is [A Basic Guide to Reproducible Research](https://binste.github.io/basic_reproducibility_guide/).

If you want to follow along with the analysis in a more interactive way, click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/master?filepath=notebooks%2F5_analysis%2F1.0-binste-analyze-crime-results-census-block-level.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, which will allow you to reproduce the final steps in order to obtain the figures used on this website - directly in your browser without any setup needed. If you want to rerun the estimation or even start out from the raw data files, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation){:target="_blank"} for instructions.
