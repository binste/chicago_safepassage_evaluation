**ATTENTION**: This is a work in progress and subject to major changes.

This website presents a non-formal introduction to an evaluation of the effect of Chicago's Safe Passage program on crime. The analysis serves as an example for [A Basic Guide to Reproducible Research](https://binste.github.io/basic_reproducibility_guide/){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to follow along with the analysis in a more interactive way, click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binste/chicago_safepassage_evaluation/master?filepath=notebooks%2F5_analysis%2F1.0-binste-analyze-crime-results-census-block-level.ipynb){:target="_blank"}, which will allow you to reproduce the final steps in order to obtain the figures used on this website - directly in your browser without any setup needed.
